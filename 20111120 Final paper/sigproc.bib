@article{Brin1998a,
abstract = {This paper presents Google, which was a prototype of a large-scale search engine at that time. The ideas in this paper was a game changer and it has become one of the most influential papers in the history of IR. This paper lacks the evaluation of the search engine in terms of user experience and precision and recall, but we already know how this proposed system changed not only the search engine market but also our everyday life. I learned actual structure and general programming facts of Google including the language it used and the process of indexing, searching, and the distributed data structure (barrels). One thing I could not understand in the paper was how PageRanks form a probability distribution and correspond to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web. I like to know more about this part and see some actual web page examples.},

abstract = {Web logs (or blogs) have become a means for citizens to share opinions and deliberate on local issues. However, the large number of blogs makes finding and exploring content of interest relatively difficult. We developed a tool that displays citizen-to citizen discussion in blogs and reveals some similarity across blog entries. Through association and content analysis, blog entries are linked to each other to form clusters of related local content. Users can navigate and explore online discussions by manipulating the graph, filtering content, and clicking on different parts of the graph. The visualization of online discussion can promote participation by highlighting the buzz of popular topics and laying out the structure of conversations. In this demo, we will show our tool in use with a digest of regional Southwest Virginia blogs.},
