abstract = {This paper presents Google, which was a prototype of a large-scale search engine at that time. The ideas in this paper was a game changer and it has become one of the most influential papers in the history of IR. This paper lacks the evaluation of the search engine in terms of user experience and precision and recall, but we already know how this proposed system changed not only the search engine market but also our everyday life. I learned actual structure and general programming facts of Google including the language it used and the process of indexing, searching, and the distributed data structure (barrels). One thing I could not understand in the paper was how PageRanks form a probability distribution and correspond to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web. I like to know more about this part and see some actual web page examples.},

abstract = {People exert large amounts of problem-solving effort playing computer games. Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.},

Users specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.},

abstract = {Web logs (or blogs) have become a means for citizens to share opinions and deliberate on local issues. However, the large number of blogs makes finding and exploring content of interest relatively difficult. We developed a tool that displays citizen-to citizen discussion in blogs and reveals some similarity across blog entries. Through association and content analysis, blog entries are linked to each other to form clusters of related local content. Users can navigate and explore online discussions by manipulating the graph, filtering content, and clicking on different parts of the graph. The visualization of online discussion can promote participation by highlighting the buzz of popular topics and laying out the structure of conversations. In this demo, we will show our tool in use with a digest of regional Southwest Virginia blogs.},
